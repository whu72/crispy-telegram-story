There once was a man named Samuel Morse. He was the inventor of the telegram. He was feeling hungry one day and decided to write a telegram for food. What did the message entail? A request for crispy chicken tenders.
Sadly, the chef who recieved the telegram was confused on what was a chicken tender. He also did not have any chicken, but he did not want Samuel Morse to be hungry, so he instead decided to make the best vegan steak. The dish will have sides of liquidless soup, plantless salad, and free-ranged potatoes.
