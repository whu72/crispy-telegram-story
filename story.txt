There once was a man named Samuel Morse. He was the inventor of the telegram. He was feeling hungry one day and decided to write a telegram for food. What did the message entail? A request for crispy chicken tenders.
Sadly, the chef who recieved the telegram was confused on what was a chicken tender. He also did not have any chicken, but he did not want Samuel Morse to be hungry, so he instead decided to make the best vegan steak. The dish will have sides of liquidless soup, plantless salad, and free-ranged potatoes. 
The wonderful meal was delivered to Morse's door after a week, but it was still warm. Morse happily opened the delivery box, and he was astonished by the absolute art he saw. However, Morse was not very delighted for the fact that he did not get the crispy chicken tender he was strong wishing for. He then decided to go argue with the chef regarding the order.
Filled with annoyance, Samuel wrote some naughty words into the telegram. He complained about the food did not meet his needs. After sending the message, he still felt unsatisfied. The next day, he thought it over and decided that he would change his profession. He realized that not enough people in the world knew what a crispy chicken tender was. Once he thought about his plan, he knew that it was the only thing truly important. Thus, he embarked on his journey to educate the world on crispy chicken tenders using his telegram.
